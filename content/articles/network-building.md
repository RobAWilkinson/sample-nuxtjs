## Network Building strategy

For 2021, want to focus on building out my own personal network of individuals, within my field.

Current Plan of attack
* Set aside 4 hours a month for meetups, strategize and use that time wisely to focus on high value meetups in my area
* Reach out to peers within my CTOs forum and setup a call a month
* Volunteer to speak at a meetup at least once a quarter this year
