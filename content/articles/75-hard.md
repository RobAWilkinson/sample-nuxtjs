## Lessons learned

Running in the cold only sucks for the first 10 minutes, then the next ten minutes, and the last ten minutes

Sweet potatoes in an instant pot are clutch.

I mostly stuck to [Metallicadpa PPL spreadsheet here](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/reddit-ppl/) but had to make changes to accessory lifts depending on gym equipment. My standard days went like this:

- Leg day: 5x5 back squats, 3x12 front squats, one legged exercises of some sort
- Pull day: Sumo Deadlift, lots of pullups, lat pull downs, alternating tbar meadows rows, facepulls
- Push day: Bench, bench a lot more
