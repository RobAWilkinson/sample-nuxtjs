# 75 Hard

Things I've learned:

You can really only do 3 things, and really only 2 of those well, if you try to do 4 things somethings going to slip


get ahead on hydration, a lot easier to drink a waterbottle in bed in the morning than it is to drink a half gallon at bedtime

eating clan and planning out eating clean can actually get you really full, you just have to do it right.

Lean ground turkey!

Running in the cold only sucks for the first 10 minutes, then the next ten minutes, and the last ten minutes

A good stretching/rolling session outdoors can count as active recovery if you work hard.

I started taking vitamins regularly, I feel they helped, who knows.

Theres a million ways to cook a chicken breast

Sweet potatoes in an instant pot are clutch.

I mostly stuck to [Metallicadpa PPL spreadsheet here](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/reddit-ppl/) but had to make changes to accessory lifts depending on gym equipment. My standard days went like this:

* Leg day: 5x5 back squats, 3x12 front squats, one legged exercises of some sort
* Pull day: Sumo Deadlift, lots of pullups, lat pull downs, alternating tbar meadows rows, facepulls
* Push day: Bench, bench a lot more
